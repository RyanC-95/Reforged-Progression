# Reforged Progression Datapack 1.21.10


**Overhauls progression, reworks Diamond & Netherite acquisition. Also enables Reinforced Deepslate and Budding Amethyst mining with strict tool requirements.**

- Mining Diamond Ore will now drop 1 Echo Shard _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_. To obtain a Diamond, place the Echo Shard in a furnace or a blasting furnace.

- Mining Ancient Debris without Silk Touch will now drop 1 Netherite Scrap. _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_

- The vanilla method of upgrading from Diamond to Netherite has been disabled.

- To obtain Netherite gear, you must craft it in the same way as Diamond gear. However, instead of using sticks to craft Netherite tools, you will need Blaze Rods.
  
- You can use a smithing table to transfer your enchantments from Diamond gear onto Netherite gear. You can also transfer enchantments from Iron gear onto Diamond gear. You will still need a Netherite Upgrade.

- Raw food can no longer be smelted in a Furnace

**You can now obtain the following blocks**

**Reinforced Deepslate**

Reinforced Deepslate can now be mined in the world.
Will only drop Reinforced Deepslate when mined with a Netherite Pickaxe that has Silk Touch.
Even if you have Silk Touch on other pickaxes, it will not work. Mining without the correct tool still breaks the block but yields nothing.

**Budding Amethyst**

Budding Amethyst can now be mined in the world.
Will only drop Budding Amethyst when mined with a Diamond Pickaxe or Netherite Pickaxe that has Silk Touch.
Even if you have Silk Touch on other pickaxes, it will not work. Mining without the correct tool still breaks the block but yields 1 Amethyst Shard instead.
