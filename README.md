- Mining Diamond Ore will now drop 1 Echo Shard _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_. To obatain a Diamond, place the Diamond in a furnace or a blasting furnce.

- The vanilla way to upgrade from Diamond to Netherite is disabled.

- To obtain Netherite gear, you need to craft it like you would with Diamond gear. Also, instead of using sticks to craft the Netherite tools, you will need Blaze Rods.
  
- You can use a smithing table to transfer your enchants from your Diamond gear onto your Netherite gear. You will still need a Netherite Upgrade though. You can also transfer your enchants from your Iron gear onto your Diamond gear.
