# Reforged Progression Datapack 1.21.10 (WIP)


**Overhauls progression and reworks Diamond and Netherite acquisition, introduces Reinforced Deepslate and Budding Amethyst mining with strict tool requirements, and adjusts crafting outputs — including sticks, doors, and Beacons — to make progression slower, more deliberate, and endgame construction more meaningful.**

## Diamond & Netherite

- The vanilla method of upgrading from Diamond to Netherite has been disabled.

- Netherite Ingots now require 4 Gold + 4 Netherite Scrap + 1 Diamond to craft.

- Netherite gear must now be crafted like Diamond gear, but the tools requires Blaze Rods instead of sticks.

- Use a smithing table to transfer enchantments: from Iron → Diamond, or Diamond → Netherite. A Netherite Upgrade is still required.

## Mining Adjustments

- Mining Diamond Ore now drops 1 Echo Shard (Fortune has no effect). Smelt the Echo Shard in a furnace or blasting furnace to obtain a Diamond.

- Mining Ancient Debris without Silk Touch now drops 1 Netherite Scrap (Fortune has no effect).

- Iron, Gold, and Copper Ore now always drop 1 Raw Ore each, even when mined with Fortune, ensuring deliberate resource gathering.

## Food

- Raw food can no longer be smelted in a furnace.

## New Obtainable Blocks

Reinforced Deepslate

- Can now be mined in the world. Only drops when mined with a Netherite Pickaxe with Silk Touch. Mining with other pickaxes, even with Silk Touch, yields nothing.

Budding Amethyst

- Can now be mined in the world. Only drops when mined with a Diamond or Netherite Pickaxe with Silk Touch. Mining with the wrong tool still breaks the block but drops 1 Amethyst Shard.

## Crafting Adjustments

- Beacons now require 3 Reinforced Deepslate, a Nether Star, and Glass, reinforcing their status as a late-game construction project.


- Glass Panes now craft 12 per recipe instead of 16, slightly increasing material costs for building.
  
- Sticks now craft 2 at a time instead of 4, slowing early-game mass crafting.

- Doors now craft 1 at a time, slowing early-game expansion.

- Torches now craft 1 at a time, making lighting a more deliberate process.
