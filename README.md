# EchidnaCraft-Datapack-1.21.10


**This Data Pack makes it harder to obtain Diamond And Netherite gear.**

- Mining Diamond Ore will now drop 1 Echo Shard _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_. To obatain a Diamond, use a furnace or a blasting furnce.

- The vanilla way to upgrade from Diamond to Netherite is disabled. instead, you need to craft it like you would with Diamond gear. However, you can use a smithing table to transfer your enchants from your Diamond gear onto your Netherite gear. You will still need a Netherite Upgrade though.
