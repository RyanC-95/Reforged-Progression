# Reforged Progression Datapack 1.21.10


**Overhauls progression, reworks Diamond & Netherite acquisition. Also enables Reinforced Deepslate and Budding Amethyst mining with strict tool requirements.**

## Diamond & Netherite

- Mining Diamond Ore now drops 1 Echo Shard (Fortune has no effect). Smelt the Echo Shard in a furnace or blasting furnace to obtain a Diamond.

- Mining Ancient Debris without Silk Touch now drops 1 Netherite Scrap (Fortune has no effect).

- The vanilla method of upgrading from Diamond to Netherite has been disabled.

- Netherite gear must now be crafted like Diamond gear, but requires Blaze Rods instead of sticks for tools.

- Use a smithing table to transfer enchantments: from Diamond → Netherite, or Iron → Diamond. A Netherite Upgrade is still required.

## Food

- Raw food can no longer be smelted in a furnace.

## New Blocks

Reinforced Deepslate

- Can now be mined in the world. Only drops when mined with a Netherite Pickaxe with Silk Touch. Mining with other pickaxes, even with Silk Touch, yields nothing.

Budding Amethyst

- Can now be mined in the world. Only drops when mined with a Diamond or Netherite Pickaxe with Silk Touch. Mining with the wrong tool still breaks the block but drops 1 Amethyst Shard.

## Crafting Adjustments

- Sticks now craft 2 at a time instead of 4, slowing early-game mass crafting.

- Doors now craft 1 at a time, slowing early-game expansion.

- Beacons now require 3 Reinforced Deepslate, a Nether Star, and Glass, reinforcing their status as a late-game construction project.
