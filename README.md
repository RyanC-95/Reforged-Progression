# EchidnaCraft-Datapack-1.21.10 (Reforged Progression)


**This Data Pack makes it harder to obtain Diamond And Netherite gear.**

- Mining Diamond Ore will now drop 1 Echo Shard _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_. To obtain a Diamond, place the Echo Shard in a furnace or a blasting furnace.

- The vanilla method of upgrading from Diamond to Netherite has been disabled.

- To obtain Netherite gear, you must craft it in the same way as Diamond gear. However, instead of using sticks to craft Netherite tools, you will need Blaze Rods.
  
- You can use a smithing table to transfer your enchantments from Diamond gear onto Netherite gear. You will still need a Netherite Upgrade, however. You can also transfer enchantments from Iron gear onto Diamond gear.

- Reinforced Deepslate can now be mined. The higher your Efficiency level, the faster it will break. You need a Netherite Pickaxe with Silk Touch enchant, otherwise it will drop Deepslate
