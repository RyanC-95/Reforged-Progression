# Reforged Progression Datapack 1.21.10


**Overhauls progression, reworks Diamond & Netherite acquisition. Also enables Reinforced Deepslate and Budding Amethyst mining with strict tool requirements.**

- Mining Diamond Ore will now drop 1 Echo Shard _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_. To obtain a Diamond, place the Echo Shard in a furnace or a blasting furnace.

- Mining Ancient Debris without Silk Touch will now drop 1 Netherite Scrap. _**(regardless if it has Fortune on it)**_

- The vanilla method of upgrading from Diamond to Netherite has been disabled.

- To obtain Netherite gear, you must craft it in the same way as Diamond gear. However, instead of using sticks to craft Netherite tools, you will need Blaze Rods.
  
- You can use a smithing table to transfer your enchantments from Diamond gear onto Netherite gear. You can also transfer enchantments from Iron gear onto Diamond gear. You will still need a Netherite Upgrade.

- Reinforced Deepslate can now be mined. The higher your Efficiency level, the faster it will break. You need a **Netherite Pickaxe** with **Silk Touch** enchant, otherwise it will drop nothing
- Budding Amethyst can now be mined using a **Diamond Pickaxe** or a **Netherite Pickaxe** with **Silk Touch** enchant, otherwise it will drop 1 Amethyst Shard

- Raw food can no longer be smelted in a Furnace
